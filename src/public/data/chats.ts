    content: `Great question! You should generally use **useCallback** when you want to memoize a function so that it doesn‚Äôt get re-created on every render. 
This is especially useful when passing callbacks down to memoized child components, preventing unnecessary re-renders. 
On the other hand, **useMemo** is used to memoize a value ‚Äî for example, the result of an expensive calculation. 
So in short: useCallback ‚Üí memoize functions, useMemo ‚Üí memoize values.`,

    content: `Absolutely. Imagine you have a component that renders a list of items, and before rendering, you need to filter, sort, or perform some heavy computation on the list. 
If the input list is large and the computation is non-trivial (like searching, sorting, or formatting), running that logic on every render can slow things down.
By wrapping the calculation in **useMemo**, React will only re-run the expensive computation when its dependencies change, rather than on every single render. 

Here‚Äôs a simplified code example:

\`\`\`jsx
const sortedItems = useMemo(() => {
  return items.sort((a, b) => a.value - b.value);
}, [items]);
\`\`\`

Without useMemo, the sort would run on every render ‚Äî even if \`items\` hasn‚Äôt changed.`,

    content: `Exactly! üöÄ You nailed it. 
While you may not notice a big performance difference in smaller apps, in larger applications where components re-render frequently, unnecessary calculations or re-creations of functions can have a cumulative impact. 
Best practice: don‚Äôt prematurely optimize ‚Äî but if you identify re-renders or recalculations that are slowing things down, that‚Äôs when useCallback and useMemo shine.`,

    content: `Yes ‚Äî React 18 introduced **concurrent features** like \`useTransition\` and \`useDeferredValue\`, which are particularly helpful for improving UI responsiveness. 
- **useTransition** lets you mark updates as ‚Äúnon-urgent,‚Äù so the UI stays snappy while React handles background state updates.
- **useDeferredValue** lets you defer re-rendering expensive parts of the UI until the main updates are done.  

These are becoming more important as applications get more interactive and data-heavy.  
Would you like me to create a sample code snippet showing \`useTransition\` in action?`,
